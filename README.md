### My dotfiles

This will create soft links in home directory for every hidden config file:  
`ln -sf  (pwd)/.* ~/`   
`ln -sf  (pwd)/i3/* ~/.config/i3/`

##### TMUX

Just copy-paste the content of .tmux.conf to your ~/.tmux.conf file or `ln -s {{path/to/file}} {{path/to/symlink}}`.

SHIFT + arrow to switch pages

The original file I stole from https://gist.github.com/spicycode/1229612.

##### Audio issues with random mute/unmute

- use the minus - key to switch it to Disabled
