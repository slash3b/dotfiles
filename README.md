##### Audio issues with random mute/unmute

https://superuser.com/questions/431079/how-to-disable-auto-mute-mode

Run alsamixer, then:
- F5 (show all controls)
- use arrows â†’ to move until hitting the <Auto-Mute> control, which show as Enabled
- use the minus - key to switch it to Disabled
- hit Esc to exit
- run alsactl store as root to save

##### nvim config

TODO in vim:
- [] a list of open files and easy switch between them (possibly a quickfix list and local fix list)
- [] file browsing and navigation ( possible also with telescope )
- [] go to definition 
- [x] search for matches and possible preview (telescope plugin)
- [] git gutter
